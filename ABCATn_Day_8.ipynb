Static binding includes method overloading, while dynamic binding involves method overriding. Understanding when each approach is used and how it affects program performance is key.\n","   \n","2. **Explain the Divide and Conquer approach in algorithm development.**\n","   - **Answer:** The Divide and Conquer approach breaks a problem into smaller sub-problems, solves them independently, and then combines the results. Examples include merge sort and quick sort algorithms.\n","   \n","3. **What are database partitioning strategies and when would you use them?**\n","   - **Answer:** Database partitioning involves splitting a database into smaller, more manageable pieces (partitions). This helps in improving performance and scalability. Common partitioning strategies include horizontal partitioning (dividing data rows) and vertical partitioning (dividing data columns).\n","   \n","4. **What are the differences between a stack and a queue?**\n","   - **Answer:** A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. Both are essential in various algorithms and scenarios.\n","\n","5. **Describe a situation where you would use a greedy algorithm.**\n","   - **Answer:** A greedy algorithm is used when you make a sequence of choices that each looks best at the moment. It's ideal when the problem has an optimal substructure and greedy choices lead to an optimal solution, such as in the activity selection problem or Huffman coding.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xyJA5OVvy-f8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Writing & Communication Fluency**\n","\n","**Write the answer of following question along with a self explanation video.**\n","\n"," **Tell me about a time when you faced a technical challenge.
