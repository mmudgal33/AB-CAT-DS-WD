that calculates the factorial of a number.\n","\n","```javascript\n","function factorial(n) {\n","    if (n === 0) return 1;\n","    return n * factorial(n - 1);\n","}\n","\n","// Example 1:\n","console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120 (5*4*3*2*1)\n","\n","// Example 2:\n","console.log(factorial(0)); // Output: 1\n","```\n","\n","**Solution Explanation:**  \n","- The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all integers from `n` down to `1`.\n","- This is implemented recursively.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. **Check if a Number is Prime**\n","\n","**Problem:** Write a function that checks if a number is prime.\n","\n","```javascript\n","function isPrime(num) {\n","    if (num <= 1) return false;\n","    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {\n","        if

of the number to optimize performance.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**\n","\n","**Problem:** Write a function to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.\n","\n","```javascript\n","function mergeSortedArrays(arr1, arr2) {\n","    let result = [];\n","    let i = 0, j = 0;\n","    \n","    while (i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {\n","

Output: [5, 6, 7, 8]\n","```\n","\n","**Solution Explanation:**  \n","- `new Set(arr)` creates a set from the array, automatically removing duplicates.\n","- The spread operator `...` converts the set back into an array.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. **Sum of All Even Numbers in an Array**\n","\n","**Problem:** Write a function that returns the sum of all even numbers in an array.\n","\n","```javascript\n","function sumEvenNumbers(arr) {\n","    return arr.filter(num => num % 2 === 0).reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);\n","}\n","\n","// Example

that flattens an array of arbitrary depth (nested arrays of varying depths).\n","\n","```javascript\n","function flattenDeep(arr) {\n","    return arr.reduce((acc, val) => acc.concat(Array.isArray(val) ? flattenDeep(val) : val), []);\n","}\n","\n","// Example 1:\n","console.log(flattenDeep([1, [2, [3, 4]], 5])); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","\n","// Example 2:\n","console.log(flattenDeep([10, [20, 30], 40])); // Output: [10, 20, 30, 40]\n","```\n","\n","**Solution Explanation:**  \n","- Recursively flatten the array using `reduce()` and

string.\n","\n","```javascript\n","function firstNonRepeatingChar(str) {\n","    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {\n","        if (str.indexOf(str[i]) === str.lastIndexOf(str[i])) {\n","            return str[i];\n","        }\n","    }\n","    return null;\n","}\n","\n","// Example 1:\n","console.log(firstNonRepeatingChar(\"swiss\")); // Output: \"w\"\n","\n","// Example 2:\n","console.log(firstNonRepeatingChar(\"aabbcc\")); // Output: null\n","```\n","\n","**Solution Explanation:**  \n","- `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()` are used to find if a character appears more than once.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 8. **Find the Longest Word in a String**\n","\n","**Problem:** Write a function that finds the longest word in a string.\n","\n","```javascript\n","function findLongestWord(str) {\n","    let words = str.split(' ');\n","    return words.reduce((longest, word) => word.length > longest.length ? word : longest, '');\n","}\n","\n","// Example 1:\n","console.log(findLongestWord(\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\")); // Output: \"jumped\"\n","\n","// Example 2:\n","console.log(findLongestWord(\"hello world\")); // Output: \"hello\"\n","```\n","\n","**Solution Explanation:**  \n","- Split the string into words and use `reduce()` to find the longest word.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 9. **Count Vowels in a String**\n","\n","**Problem:** Write a function that counts the number of vowels in a string.\n","\n","```javascript\n","function countVowels(str) {\n","    return str.match(/[aeiouAEIOU]/g) ? str.match(/[aeiouAEIOU]/g).length : 0;\n","}\n","\n","// Example 1:\n","console.log(countVowels(\"hello\")); // Output: 2\n","\n","// Example 2:\n","console.log(countVowels(\"JavaScript\")); // Output: 3\n","```\n","\n","**Solution Explanation:**  \n","- Use a regular expression `/[aeiouAEIOU]/g` to match all vowels.\n","- `match()` returns an array of matches, and its `length` gives the count.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 10. **Find the Missing Number in a Sequence**\n","\n","**Problem:** Write a function that finds the missing number in a sequence of consecutive numbers.\n","\n","```javascript\n","function findMissing(arr) {\n","    const n = arr.length + 1;\n","    const totalSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;  // Sum of numbers from 1 to n\n","    const arrSum = arr.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);\n","    return totalSum - arrSum;\n","}\n","\n","// Example 1:\n","console.log(findMissing([1, 2, 4, 5, 6])); // Output: 3\n","\n","// Example 2:\n","console.log(findMissing([10, 11, 12, 14])); // Output: 13\n","```\n","\n","**Solution Explanation:**  \n","- Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n","- Subtract the sum of the array from the total sum to find the missing number.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"1E6qddWKTDUt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Technical
