When would you choose one over the other?**\n","   - *SQL databases* are structured and use tables for storing data with defined schemas (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), while *NoSQL databases* (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) allow unstructured data with flexible schemas.\n","   - Choose *SQL* when you need ACID compliance and structured relationships (e.g., financial applications). Choose *NoSQL* for scalability, large amounts of unstructured data, or when you need high availability and speed, such as for social media platforms or IoT.\n","\n","2. **Can you explain what a microservice architecture is and how you would design a system using this approach?**\n","   - Microservices involve breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, self-contained services that handle specific business functions. Each service can be deployed and scaled independently. In your design, you'd use RESTful APIs or messaging systems for communication between services, databases for each service, and ensure data consistency using techniques like event sourcing or CQRS.\n","\n","3. **What are some common strategies to scale an application for high availability?**\n","   - Use techniques such as horizontal scaling (adding more servers), database replication, load balancing, and caching strategies (like Redis or Memcached). You could also implement failover mechanisms and use cloud-native services like Kubernetes for auto-scaling.\n","\n","4. **Explain the CAP theorem and its implications for database design.**\n","   - The *CAP theorem* (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two out of three properties. For example, in a system designed for high availability, you might sacrifice consistency, leading to temporary data inconsistencies during network partitions.\n","\n","5. **What are the trade-offs involved in choosing between synchronous and asynchronous processing in distributed systems?**\n","   - *Synchronous* processing ensures immediate consistency but can result in performance bottlenecks due to waiting for responses. *Asynchronous* processing improves throughput and system responsiveness, but it can introduce complexity in managing eventual consistency and handling failures.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xyJA5OVvy-f8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Writing & Communication Fluency**\n","\n","**Write the answer of following question along with a self explanation video.**\n","\n","**Describe a situation in which you had to communicate a message to someone resistant to it and how you handled it.**\n","   - Focus on a scenario where you had to address someone's reluctance.
